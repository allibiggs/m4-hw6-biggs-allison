## Issues
I had quite a few issues when completing this assignment. I mostly felt lost and wasn't sure what to do. I could imaging the solution in different pieces, but putting them together to actually solve the issue was the hard part. 

## Resources
I utilized the recorded lectures for this module, the LinkedIn Essential Training Javascript tutorials, and the live lectures/code from Professor Warrick.
